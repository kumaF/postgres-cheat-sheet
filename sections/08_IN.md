## PostgreSQL `IN`

### Overview 
Learn how to use the PostgreSQL `IN` operator in the `WHERE` clause to check if a value matches any value in a list.

### Syntax

```
SELECT
    select_column_list
FROM
    schema_name.table_name
WHERE
    column_value IN (value1, value2, ...);
```

```
SELECT
    select_column_list
FROM
    schema_name.table_name
WHERE
    column_value IN (SELECT column_name FROM schema_name.table_name);
```

### Examples

1) `IN` operator in `WHERE` clause
    
    ```
    SELECT first_name, last_name
	FROM public.customer
    WHERE customer_id IN (1,2);
    ```
    is equivalent to

    ```
    SELECT first_name, last_name
	FROM public.customer
    WHERE customer_id = 1 OR customer_id = 2;
    ```
2) `NOT IN` operator in `WHERE` clause
    
    ```
    SELECT first_name, last_name
	FROM public.customer
    WHERE customer_id NOT IN (1,2);
    ```
    is equivalent to

    ```
    SELECT first_name, last_name
	FROM public.customer
    WHERE customer_id != 1 AND customer_id != 2;
    ```
3) `IN` operator with a subquery
    
    ```
    SELECT first_name, last_name
	FROM public.customer
    WHERE customer_id IN (
        SELECT customer_id
        FROM public.rental
        WHERE return_date::date = '2005-05-27'
    );
    ```

### Summary
- Use `IN` operator in the `WHERE` clause to check if a value matches any value in a list of values.
- Also you can use `IN` operator with a subquery as well.
